# Commits message naming

> [!NOTE]
> Long story short, we use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) together with an emoji corresponding to the commit type.

## MyFilmList's Conventional Commits

See how [a minor change](#examples) to your commit message style can make a difference.

> [!TIP]
> Have a look at **[git-conventional-commits](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits)** , a CLI util to ensure these conventions, determine version and generate changelogs
